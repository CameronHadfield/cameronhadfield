### Hi there! Welcome to my github profile!
My name is Cameron, and I am a big tech fan from Ontario, Canada. Read on if you want to know a little more about me!

- ðŸŽ“ I am currently in school for Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and expect to graduate in April 2023
- ðŸ“œ I am looking for internship opportunities for the Winter 2022 term (Jan '22-Apr '22)
- ðŸ’» I love tech! I am an avid computer hardware enthusiast, and have come to be very interested in homelab stuff over the past year
- ðŸŽ® I also love playing games! My favourite games I played in 2020 had to be Doom Eternal and Red Dead Redemption 2, and I am always looking for new things to play!
- âŒ¨ I really enjoy programming in my free time, and hope to put more of an emphasis on that with the latter half of 2021
- ðŸ”Ž My main programming interests are (right now): Cryptography, learning embedded, and game development (text-based or 3D)


Feel free to get in touch if you want to try to do something together! I really can't cover everything I like in one blurb, and I'm always open to new opportunties.
